The Carif-Oref Network needed to overhaul its showcase site developed under Drupal 7. The complexity of this overhaul lay in the complete integration of the Offerinfo search engine to replace the existing engine, thus making it possible to standardize the different interfaces in one same site. The engine developed under Drupal 8 has been designed in the form of several forms which require a webservice. The latter returns lists of results from training, organizations or certifications in an xml format standardized in Lh√©o 2.2 format. The difficulty consisted in displaying the results fluidly, in a table or on a map, as well as the descriptive pages of each entity. No content is inserted in Drupal and everything is dynamic.
