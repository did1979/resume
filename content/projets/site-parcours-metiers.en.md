Commissioned by the Normandy Region, the project consisted in providing a fast and efficient search to display on a map the reception and information places in Normandy. The site also had to offer one entry per audience in order to guide the fnction research of Internet users who consult. Technically, the data is extracted every night in JSON format thanks to a Symfony webservice. The JSON data is then displayed with dynamic pages developed in Angular.
